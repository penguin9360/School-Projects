# Lab Resources and Machine Problems

## Lab Location

* Siebel Center 2325/2327

* This is a restricted access lab, and we have set up some monitors and keyboards for you to use. Please let us know if you have trouble accessing the room or using the equipment.

## Equipment Setup

* In CS 424, we will be programming an iRobot create using a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. iRobot Create is a robotics platform that can be programmed through a serial interface called OI (Open Interface) and `libirobot-create`. We will be able to read the sensors, and control the actuators. Raspberry Pi is a small single-board computer with USB WiFi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, HDMI, Audio, and GPIO connectivity. When the iRobot is in motion, the Raspberry Pi is powered through an external battery.

* You want to use connect the iRobot Create Serial Cable with the iRobot Create base, and use the Serial to USB adapter to connect the Raspberry Pi, which will be powered through the provided battery pack.

## Instructions Layout

* For each lab assignment, go to corresponding folder in this repo to see detailed instructions for that assignment.
