# iRobot Portal

* This repo contains the portal I built for students to discover the ip address of their Raspberry Pis.
* Everything should work out of the box. Simply follow a Django tutorial on how to deploy the project would get the job done.
* Feel free to modify the files as you wish. `test.sh` contains a Cron job that students will set up on their Raspberry Pi to ping the server (acts like a client)
