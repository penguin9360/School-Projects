     * Please name your Pokemon: Dolphin <br>

     * Sorry. Hit points must be between 1 and 50: 55 <br>
     * Sorry. Hit points must be between 1 and 50: 50 <br>
     * Split fifty points between attack level and defense level <br>
     * Enter your attack level (1-49): -10 <br>
     * Sorry. The attack level must be between 1 and 49: 73 <br>
